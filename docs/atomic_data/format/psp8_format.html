<div class="level3">

<p>
(Note: the implementation of format 8 was done by D. R. Hamann).
</p>

<p>
The format 8 for ABINIT pseudopotentials is designed to allow users
who wish to experiment with pseudopotentials, possibly with non-standard
features, to have great flexibility in doing so.
It does not correspond to any publicly available tabulation.
The open-source ONCVPSP package available at <a href="http://www.mat-simresearch.com" class="urlextern" title="http://www.mat-simresearch.com" rel="ugc nofollow">www.mat-simresearch.com</a> produces pseudopotentials in this
format.
</p>

<p>
An annotated example is presented in detail below, followed by a second
example incorporating spin-orbit coupling.  An extended discussion follows
below the examples, with a separate section discussing spin-orbit as produced by ONCVPSP.
</p>

<p>
When first producing a pseudopotential in this format, it would be a very
good idea to do a well-converged calculation of an isolated atom in a big
box to confirm that you are correctly recreating the atomic valence levels you intend.
</p>

<p>
The format is best explained by an example, which is presented in
detail below.  (The example is excerpted from Psps_for_tests/20ca_sic.drh.
Another example of pspcod=8 is Psps_for_tests/8o_sic.drh.)
All but the last data block of this file are read in subroutine psp8in.f.

DISCUSSION
</p>
<hr>

<p>
This introduces a norm-conserving pseudopotential input file format
designed by D. R. Hamann which offers additional flexibility over
previously available Abinit psp formats, as well as possible improvements
in performance in certain respects.  Its new features are:
</p>

<p>
(1)
Numerical psp's, which offer the ability to experiment beyond existing
tabulated collections.  Available psp's given as basis function sums
are easily convertible to this format.
</p>

<p>
(2)
Linear radial grids, which have the following advantages:
</p>
<pre class="code">  (a) Computational efficiency compared to log grids because the
      core region of those grids is highly redundant for psp's.</pre>
<pre class="code">  (b) Increased accuracy at large ecut values.  The spacing of
      mesh points for log grids at larger radii, where there are
usually still significant contributions to the psp's, becomes
too large and introduces aliasing noise into the Fourier-
transform psp's.  In fact, this code is written to double,
triple, etc. the linear grid and interpolate prior to performing
the transform to ensure accuracy, based on ecut.</pre>
<pre class="code">  (c) Storage economy (probably not important in modern computers, but
      the files are easier to read).</pre>
<pre class="code">  (d) While redundant, repeating the grid in the data block with each
      function facilitates inspection and plotting of the various inputs.</pre>

<p>
(3)
Allowance for any number of nonlocal projectors for each anugular
momentum channel, previously available for several formats but without
the current flexibility.
</p>

<p>
(4)
Direct input of the Bloechl-Kleinman-Bylander projectors rather
than wave functions and semi-local potentials.  This allows greater
flexibility important for some exploratory applications such
as self-interaction-corrected psp's.  The projectors are applied
to the wave functions as the following operators
</p>
<pre class="code">                 Sum_(nlm)    |fkb(n,l),m&gt; ekb(n,l) &lt;fkb(n,l),m|
                 </pre>

<p>
The conventional Kleinman-Bylander choice for a single projector (single n) would be
</p>
<pre class="code">                 fkb(r,l) = (V(r,l)-V_loc(r))u(r,l),</pre>

<p>
where V(r,l) is the semi-local norm-conserving pseudopotential for
angular momentum l, V_loc® is the local potential, and u(r,l) is
the radial Schroedinger equation solution (bound or scattering).[1,2]
Note that u® has the conventional “r” factor, u®=r*psi®.
In this case, the “energies” ekb (which have dimensions 1/energy
for the above definition of fkb) are
</p>
<pre class="code">                 ekb(l) = 1 / [Integral_(0, inf) fkb(r,l)*u(r,l) dr]</pre>

<p>
(no 4*Pi factor).  For the Bloechl generalization, see [3].
Other possible generalizations include the treatment of self-
interaction corrections as additional projectors.[4]
</p>

<p>
Finally, creating numerical projectors as part of the psp generation
process (rather than within Abinit) allows one to solve the radial
Schrodinger equation in its fully nonlocal form and compare logarithmic
derivatives of the pseudo and all-electron wave functions over a wide
energy range.  This is a superior test of transferability, and will
locate shallow “ghost resonances” above the reference valence
states, which would be missed in the standard ghost tests [5] but
can lead to poor results.
</p>

<p>
(5)
Ability to use an arbitrary local potential rather than that for
one particular angular momentum channel.  This can be helpful in
eliminating ghost states.[5]
</p>

<p>
In the example above, a calcium pseudopotential, the “conventional”
choice of the d-channel (lloc=2) for the local potential is particuarly
bad because the incipient d shell represented by a shallow d
resonance leads to a very deep d potential.  With this potential as
local, it is nearly impossible to avoid ghost states.  Using p as
the local potential would avoid this, but would place a spurious
core-orthogonalization repulsive term in channels for higher angular
momenta (f, g, h, …) which could lead to errors in, for example,
lattice constants.  The local potential here was formed by a
smooth (polynomial) extrapolation of the tail-region all-electron
potential to the origin.  While some other Abinit psp formats
include the ability to form the local potential as a simple average
over semi-local potentials, the d potential would likely still cause
problems in this case.
</p>

<p>
(6)
Spherical bessel functions for Fourier transforms in the psp8*.f
routines are computed by a highly accurate recursion method in sbf8.f,
and all angular momentum channels are treated simultaneously,
increasing accuracy and efficiency compared to sin/cos formulations,
especially for large and small arguments.
</p>

<p>
(7)
The ability to experiment with various model core charges for the
non-linear core correction[6] is advantageous.  Functions that are
not sufficiently smooth can lead to potentially severe convergence
errors, especially in response function calculations.  For other
formats, Abinit internally generates higher derivatives of the model
core charge up to the 4th derivative, and piecewise-constructed
model functions that LOOK smooth can cause havoc.  The requirement
that all the derivatives to be present in the input file permits
early detection of such problems, and aids their remediation.

Release 7.x introduces the ablity to include spin-orbit coupling.  The
Pt pseudopotential used as an example above was initially generated
with two non-local projectors each from Dirac wave functions with j=l+1/2
and j=l-1/2 using Vanderbilt generalized norm conservation, which
gives much greater accuracy than the Bloechl construction discussed
above.[7]  Weighted sums and differences of these non-local operators
were separately re-diagonalized to produce efficient orthonormal
projectors for the scalar-relativistic and spin-orbit terms which are
required internally by abinit.  For a detailed description of the
projectors, see Ref. 7.  The operation of SR and SO terms on the
spinor wave functions is a straightforward generalization of

where “fkb” and “ekb” are appropriately reinterpreted.  Since the
“fkb” for the Pt example are orthonormal, the “ekb” have the
dimensions energy.  Projectors with negligibly small energies
(&lt;2E-5 Ha at present) are neglected.  There is full flexibiltiy
to use other methods to generate the SR and SO terms.
