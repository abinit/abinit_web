<h3>Plane wave based electronic structure calculations using DMFT and projected local orbitals</h3>
<p><em>AMADON Bernard</em> - 
The
description of realistic strongly correlated systems has
recently advanced through the combination of density functional theory
in the local density approximation (LDA) and dynamical mean field
theory (DMFT). This LDA+DMFT method is able to treat both strongly
correlated insulators and metals. Several interfaces between LDA and
DMFT have been used, such as (N<sup>th</sup> order) linear muffin-tin orbitals or
maximally localized Wannier functions. Such schemes are, however,
either complex in use or additional simplifications are often performed
(<i>i.e.</i>, the atomic sphere approximation). We present an alternative
implementation of LDA+DMFT, which keeps the precision of the Wannier
implementation, but which is lighter [1]. It relies on the projection
of localized orbitals onto a restricted set of Kohn-Sham states to
define the correlated subspace. The method is implemented within the
projector augmented wave and within the mixed-basis pseudopotential
frameworks. This opens the way to electronic structure calculations
within LDA+DMFT for more complex structures with the precision of an
all-electron method. In this presentation, we will briefly present the
theoretical framework, discuss practical details and prospects of the
implementation, and give some examples of applications.</p>

<h3>Computational investigation of the atomic structure of Mn-rich 
nanocolumns: comparison with a possible GeMn ordered compound</h3>
<p><em>ARRAS Emmanuel</em> - 
High curie temperature (> 400K) GeMn alloys have recently been grown 
by means of low temperature molecular beam epitaxy. The samples 
exhibit Mn-rich nanostructures embedded in a nearly pure germanium 
matrix. The composition of theses nanostructures is close to 
Ge<sub>2</sub>Mn but their atomic structure is still puzzling.
A recent Extended X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) study reveals 
that these nanostructures present a complex local structure that does 
not correspond to any known stable GeMn compound&nbsp;[2]. Based on 
electronic structure calculations we have investigated both magnetic and 
structural properties of a possible GeMn ordered compound found in 
similar transition-metal metalloid systems. The comparison is based on 
both magnetic properties of the relaxed compounds as well as their 
simulated EXAFS spectra. This methodology was first validated on the 
Ge<sub>3</sub>Mn<sub>5</sub> compound and then applied to other ordered 
compounds. Moreover the Curie temperature is calculated by means of 
coupled KKR-Monte Carlo calculations for the compounds that exhibit a 
stable ferromagnetic ordering.</p>

<h3>How to be a distribution-friendly project</h3>
<!--<a class="pdf" href="pdf/Berkholz.pdf"><img src="pdf.png" alt="pdf" />[2.6M]</a>-->
<!--<a class="pdf" href="pdf/abinit_gentoo_standalone.odp"><img src="odp.png" alt="odp" />[2.5M]</a>-->
<p><em>BERKHOLZ Donnie</em> - 

Getting ABINIT integrated into Linux distributions will help to increase its adoption and to ensure that users have ABINIT well-integrated into their systems and kept up-to-date easily. ABINIT is already packaged in Gentoo Linux, and Donnie will share his experience creating and maintaining ABINIT's Gentoo package and offer suggestions for improvement.  Technical and philosophical questions that determine how easy or difficult it is for distribution packagers to work with ABINIT developers will be discussed. Technical issues include the basic metaphor that ABINIT's build and installation process is an API to distribution packages -- it should be changed carefully and purposefully, and changes should be well-documented. In addition, Donnie will describe the level of control and system integration desired by packagers. Philosophical issues, including user expectations and licensing requirements, differ between distributions and can cause major conflicts with upstream developers. Finally, Donnie will discuss developments toward the future of distribution packaging so that ABINIT developers can consider how this fits into the future of ABINIT. </p>

<h3>Superconductivity near a lattice phase transition: the case of NbN</h3>
<p><em>BLACKBURN Simon</em> - 

We
report the study of the electron-phonon coupling in NbC<sub>1-x</sub>N<sub>x</sub> crystals
in the rocksalt structure. The Kohn anomaly associated with the
topology of the Fermi surface greatly increases the electron-phonon
coupling and induces a structural instability when the electronic
density of states reaches a critical value. We develop a model of the
Eliashberg spectral function where the effect of the unstable phonons
is set apart. We show that this model within the McMillan formula can
reproduce the increase of T<sub>c</sub> near the structural phase transition.</p>

<h3>From application-centric to data-centric computation: use of <i>ab 
 initio</i> methods in applied research</h3>
<!--<a class="pdf" href="pdf/Blaise.pdf"><img src="pdf.png" alt="pdf" />[1.9M]</a>-->
<p><em>BLAISE Philippe</em> - 

We present some results in applied electronics obtained with ab initio 
methods: computation of realistic band offsets of a
high-K MOS gate stack, using a combination of Siesta (DFT/LDA) and 
Abinit (G<sub>0</sub>W<sub>0</sub>),
calculation of electronic levels useful for future development of 
flash memories. A more general discussion will follow
about crucial differences when one uses ab initio methods for 
fundamental or applied research.
Some perspectives will be drawn about the embedding of an application 
like Abinit in a typical workflow for e-science.</p>

<h3><i>Ab initio</i> calculation on three levels of parallelization </h3>
<!--<a class="pdf" href="pdf/Bottin.pdf"><img src="pdf.png" alt="pdf" />[416k]</a>-->
<p><em>BOTTIN Fran�ois</em> - 

 Three
levels of parallelization [1] are now available in the ABINIT code
package. Indifferently, these ones can be used separately or coupled
the ones with the others. To the parallelization on <i>k</i>-points,
previously introduced into the code, we add two others of them acting
on bands and plane waves. These two last levels of parallelization are
based on two algorithms previously introduced in the code: on one hand,
a three-dimensional Fast Fourier Transform (3dim-FFT) [2], which allows
a parallelization on plane waves, and on the other hand, a blocked
eigensolver (LOBPCG) [3], in order to perform a band parallelization.
First, we briefly recall the implementation and the efficiency of this
parallelization. In particular, we indicate the last implementations
carried out in the code and the new features which are now available.
Then we focus on various sudies, involving a large number of CPUs (up
to one thousand), bands (a few thousands), atoms (a few hundreds)
and/or plane waves [4], in order to illustrate the use of this
parallelization. For each system we indicate the CPU time needed to
perform such a calculation.</p>

<h3>Temperature Dependance of the band energies of semiconductors </h3>
<!--<a class="pdf" href="pdf/boulanger.pdf"><img src="pdf.png" alt="pdf" />[3.3M]</a>-->
<p><em>BOULANGER Paul</em> -
The band energies of semiconductors are known to exhibit significant shifts and broadening with the variation of temperature. At constant volume, this dependance is a consequence of the renormalization of band energies  due to electron-phonon interactions. This effect was first fully described in a formalism developed by Cardona and coworkers[1] within a semi-empirical context.</p>
<p>We have reanalyzed this formalism in a density functional perturbation theory approach (DFPT). This new formalism includes an extra term, the non-diagonal Debye-Waller term, which can be calculated with the help of DFPT. We have studied the importance of this contribution on diatomic molecules using  frozen phonon and DFPT calculations. For the H<sub>2</sub> molecule, it contributes to up to 15% of the total temperature dependence. This formalism might help explain the discrepancy still found between calculations  and experiments for solids[2].</p>
<p>In this presentation, the details of this implementation in the Abinit package will be discussed and examples on how it can be used will be given.</p>

<h3>Fast GW approximation with only a few empty states </h3>
<!--<a class="pdf" href="pdf/Bruneval.pdf"><img src="pdf.png" alt="pdf" />[2.5M]</a>-->
<p><em>BRUNEVAL Fabien</em> - 

The GW approximation to the electronic self-energy yields band structures in excellent agreement with experimental data. Unfortunately, this type of calculation is extremely cumbersome even for nowadays computers. The huge number of empty states required both in the calculation of the polarizability and of the self-energy is a major bottleneck in GW calculations. We propose an almost costless scheme, which allows to divide the number of empty states by about a factor of five to reach the same accuracy. The computational cost and the memory requirements are decreased by the same amount, accelerating all calculations from small primitive cells to large supercells. I will describe how this method has been implemented in Abinit.</p>

<h3>Parser and visualisation: how to link ABINIT and V_Sim?</h3>
<!--<a class="pdf" href="pdf/Caliste.pdf"><img src="pdf.png" alt="pdf" />[1.2M]</a>-->
<p><em>CALISTE Damien</em> - Dealing with developments around the main ABINIT loop, this talk will
focus on two linked topics. The first one will present how the input
file parser has been extracted and is now exposed to third party
developers. The second topic will deal with the visualisation
		      capabilities of V_Sim&nbsp;[1] developed these last two years and specifically
these related to ABINIT.</p>

<p>Either before the calculation for checking purposes or after the
calculation for analysis and sorting purposes, one would like to
access the ABINIT input file easily and independently from the
language one uses. The ABINIT parser is a quite complex object that
would be useless to duplicate and which has interesting capabilities
like the unit parameters, the array notation, the data sets... A
Fortran90 module has thus been created linking with the ABINIT own
routines. The purpose of this module is to expose an object oriented
interface to be able to bind easily in scripting languages like Python.
This part of the talk will present the available interfaces in
Fortran90, C and Python.</p>

<p>The development of V_Sim&nbsp;[1] has tightly followed the development of
computational softwares around ABINIT. Indeed, using the C
bindings of the ABINIT parser, one can now visualise directly whatever
step of a data set directly loading the input file. Beside that,
several capabilities have been added, like the box duplication
that allows to clearly understand the atomic relations from a file
describing a primitive cell; or the density mapping, the
interactive geometry modifications...</p>

<h3>High-pressure study of water ices VII-VIII-X</h3>
<p><em>CARACAS Razvan</em> - 

We
study high-pressure solid H<sub>2</sub>O ice: the lattice dynamical properties of
ice X and the transition path between molecular ices VII/VIII and the
ionic ice X with first-principles calculations using density functional
theory in the ABINIT implementation. Our work [1] defines the dynamical
stability of ice X between about 120 GPa up to about 400 GPa. Based on
phonon band dispersion we show that the phase transition sequence at
low temperature and high pressures in ice is ice VIII - disordered ice
X - ice X - ice Pbcm. The disordered ice X is due to a phonon collapse
in the whole Brillouin zone at pressures below 120 GPa, phonon that
corresponds to hydrogen atoms bouncing back and forth between every two
oxygen neighbors in a double well potential. Post-ice X is orthorhombic
Pbcm and appears due to phonon instability in M at pressures higher
than 400 GPa that distorts the bcc cubic sublattice of oxygen atoms
into a hcp-like structure. Our calculations validate earlier
theoretical predictions for a phase transition to a post-ice X
structure in H<sub>2</sub>O [2]. We also identify and discuss the (meta)stability
of several intermediate phases between ice VIII and ice X and try to
explain some new experimental data. </p>

<p><em>DEUTSCH Thierry</em> - The python script abilint is used to generate automatically interfaces 
from Fortran routines and dependencies in the build system.
This script was developed to help developers with the goal to be 
ignored. Due to the diversity of developers, this objective was achieved 
by developing a Fortran parser!</p>
<p>In this talk, I will present the main characteristics of abilint and

<h3><i>ab initio</i> simulation of large systems in complex environments : the BigDFT project</h3>
<!--<a class="pdf" href="pdf/Genovese-bigdft.pdf"><img src="pdf.png" alt="pdf" />[1.7M]</a>-->
<!--<a class="pdf" href="pdf/Genovese-gpu.pdf"><img src="pdf.png" alt="pdf" />[372k]</a>-->
<p><em>GENOVESE Luigi</em> - 

The european BigDFT project has developed an <i>ab initio</i> Density Functional Theory code based on Daubechies wavelets. Such functions have features which make them a powerful and promising basis set for application in materials science. These are a compact support multiresolution basis, and form one of the few examples of systematic real space basis sets. For these reasons they are an optimal basis for expanding localised information. The real space description they provide allows to build an efficient, clean method to treat systems in complex environments, like surfaces geometries or system with a net charge. The mathematical properties of the formalism are optimal to build a robust, highly optimised code, conceived for systems of few hundred atoms, with excellent efficiency on parallel computers.  During this talk we will illustrate the main features of the code, its actual performances and capabilities. We will then conclude by outlining the planned developments and the potentialities of this powerful formalism in the context of electronic structure calculations.</p>

<p><em>GONZE Xavier</em> - 

Over the years, many different people have submitted contributions to the ABINIT project. Despite their diversity, the vast majority of these contributions have been successfully integrated into ABINIT, without ABINIT falling apart... I will survey the reasons, the tools and software techniques that have made this possible. This will give justification to the presence of the rules to be followed by developers, concerning automatic tests, structure of the files, requested documentation, etc. , and, I hope, also more motivation to follow them !</p>

<h3>Local
exact exchange in the Projector Augmented-Waves framework:
Implementation in the ABINIT code, validation, and application to
actinide compounds</h3>
<p><em>JOLLET Francois</em> - 
Exact exchange is used to describe correlated orbitals in the Projector Augmented Waves (PAW)framework. As suggested recently in another context [1], Hartree-Fock exchange energy is used for strongly correlated electrons only inside the PAW atomic spheres. This is done thanks to the PBE0 exchange-correlation hybrid form functional. This method is tested on NiO and results well agree with already published results and LDA+U calculations. It is then applied to UO<sub>2</sub> and PuO<sub>2</sub> for which the results well agree too with LDA+U calculations, but without adjustable parameter.</p>

<h3>MAPS - A flexible modeling environment for efficient delivery of Open Source code</h3>
<!--<a class="pdf" href="pdf/Scienomics.pdf"><img src="pdf.png" alt="pdf" />[1.1M]</a>-->
<p><em>KROKIDIS Xenophon</em> - 
The Materials And Processes Simulations Platform (MAPS) is a molecular modeling
environment offering a variety of tools allowing the building of molecular models (finite
and periodic), the access to simulation codes, job management and analysis of results.
Today the technology in MAPS covers the areas of quantum, classical, mesoscale and
chemical engineering simulations. Moreover, MAPS offers full Python scripting capability
that allows the creation of customized graphical user interfaces and simulation
scenarios.</p>
<p>Scienomics likes to promote the MAPS platform as a key tool to help open source
solutions to become more popular in the scientific community. The plugin based
architecture of MAPS and its robust Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) toolbox
make MAPS an excellent tool for developing graphical user interfaces for simulation
engines. The usage of a simulation code within MAPS is facilitated even for non expert
users since they can benefit also of all auxiliary technology in MAPS (builders,
visualization, analysis and other simulation engines). This is particularly important for
industrial users who usually perform multi-scale modeling.</p>
<p>MAPS includes an interface to ABINIT and to other open source or free simulation
engines. In particular ABINIT users can easily build their models and perform some of the
sophisticated calculations allowed by ABINIT with a few steps guided by the graphical
user interface. Moreover, the results can be visualized and analyzed within the
framework of MAPS.</p>
<p>However, in order to increase efficiency a close collaboration with the communities
developing the open source tools and Scienomics is required to deliver (a higher) high
end technology to the industrial community.</p>

<h3>A Recursion method in abinit</h3>
<!--<a class="pdf" href="pdf/Mancini.pdf"><img src="pdf.png" alt="pdf" />[912k]</a>-->
<p><em>MANCINI Marco</em> - 

Classical Abinit simulations are limited to temperatures up to approximately 10eV as  a consequence of the very rapid growth of the number of electronic states when solving the Mermin-Kohn-Sham effective Schr�dinger equation.   The recursion method is based on a direct evaluation of the density matrix in the real space representation. This allows for an orbital free  computation of the charge density in the Kohn-Sham formalism at finite temperature whose numeric complexity increases linearly with the size of the system (order N method).  In our implementation, the density matrix is computed by a recursion method based on the Trotter formula which allows simulation up to very high temperatures.  We  present the Recursion method and its  Abinit implementation,  its advantages  (high temperature simulations, good parallelization  properties) and limitations (low temperature performance,  no yet non-local potential).   We illustrate the assessment with numerical tests performed to the computation of the Hugoniot curve of cryogenic Helium using two different pseudo-potentials, and we compare our results with Path Integral Monte Carlo simulations and experimental data.</p>

<h3>An <i>ab initio</i> tool for excited state calculations</h3>
<!--<a class="pdf" href="pdf/Marini.pdf"><img src="pdf.png" alt="pdf" />[13M]</a>-->
<p><em>MARINI Andrea</em> - 

Yambo[1]
aims to be a combination of several projects devoted to the device of
new theoretical and/or numerical tools for calculating, <i>ab
initio</i>, the excited state properties of electronic systems. In
practice, Yambo is a mixed Fortran/C code composed of a core part and
many extensions. These extensions are pieces of code embodied in the
main Yambo trunk, that can be isolated or joint together. The result is
one source but many possible executables. The core of yambo
calculates quasiparticle energies and optical properties within the
framework of many-body perturbation theory and time-dependent density
functional theory, and it is released under the GPL license.
Quasiparticle energies are calculated within the GW approximation for
the self-energy. Optical properties are evaluated either by solving the
Bethe-Salpeter equation or by using the adiabatic local density
approximation. However yambo features are very much extended by the
different projects that cohabit in the code: total energy,
electron-phonon coupling, surface spectroscopy, non equilibrium
time-dependent dynamics, and so on. Yambo is a plane-wave code that,
although particularly suited for calculations of periodic bulk systems,
has been applied to a large variety of physical systems. Yambo relies
on efficient numerical techniques devised to treat systems with reduced
dimensionality, or with a large number of degrees of freedom. The code
has a user-friendly command-line based interface, flexible I/O
procedures and is interfaced to Abinit, PWscf and with the "ETSF file
format"[2]. In this talk I will outline the history of the code and
its philosophy. I will briefly describe some of the code's features and
specific numerical tools. I will also present the projects that cohabit
in the code and some of the most recent and intriguing results[3] we
have obtained thanks to yambo.</p>

<h3>libxc - a library of exchange and correlation functionals</h3>
<!--<a class="pdf" href="pdf/Marquez.pdf"><img src="pdf.png" alt="pdf" />[1.5M]</a>-->
<p><em>MARQUEZ Miguel</em> - 

The
central quantity of density functional theory is the so-called
exchange-correlation energy functional. Many approximations exist for
it (probably of the order of 150-200), and they are usually arranged in
families (LDA, GGA, meta-GGAs, etc.) In spite of these theoretical
advances, most computer codes only include a very limited quantity of
functionals, typically around 10-15. This choice usually contains the
most popular variants, like the Perdew-Zunger or the Perdew-Wang LDAs,
or the PBE or BLYP GGAs, but misses many of the old functionals (that
are important to reproduce old results) or some of the most recent
developments. With this in mind, we have developed libxc, a library of
exchange and correlation functionals. This library already includes
more than 100 functionals, is available under the LGPL license, and can
be easily called both from C and Fortran. Furthermore, it also
particularly adapted not only for ground-state calculations, but also
for response calculations, as it includes higher derivatives of the
exchange-correlation energy</p>

<h3>New Phosphors for White LEDs : Theory and Experiment</h3>
<!--<a class="pdf" href="pdf/Mikami.pdf"><img src="pdf.png" alt="pdf" />[1.5M]</a>-->
<p><em>MIKAMI Masayoshi</em> - 

A trend to search for new phosphors for white LEDs has been acceralating, because white LEDs are highly expected as one of the most promising light sources with much less energy consumption (less CO<sub>2</sub> gas exhaustion) than conventional light sources such as incandescent lamp. In this presentation, we will present how our nitride/oxynitride phosphors have been developed by close cooperation between theory and experiment. In particular, it will be stressed that ABINIT computation was greatly helpful for the discussion on the feasibility of phosphor synthesis as well as the determination of crystal structures. Outlook and issues will be discussed for possible "<i>ab initio</i> design" of phosphor materials.</p>

electronic structure calculation. Written in modern, modular FORTRAN,
independence from the basis set and methodology used for the underlying 
electronic structure calculation is a fundamental design feature of the

presented, with particular emphasis on the elements required for a

<h3>Running ABINIT in a GRID environment</h3>
<p><em>OLIVEIRA Micael</em> -

GRID computing facilities are becoming widely available, as they allow research institutions to share their computational resources in an effective and efficient way. Nevertheless, up to now, usage of GRID facilities to run ab-initio codes, like ABINIT, has not been very popular. One of the reasons for this was the deficient MPI support. Indeed, GRID facilities were initially designed having in mind large amounts of small serial jobs, but this is now changing, as support for MPI jobs started to become widely available.    In this talk we will present our experience in running ABINIT in a GRID using the GLite software, both in serial and parallel modes. We will discuss the problems encountered, as well as how these were solved. A short introduction to GRID concepts will also be presented.</p>

<h3>The mutation of Abinit</h3>
<p><em>POUILLON Yann</em> - 

During the five last years Abinit has undergone a comprehensive mutation
at various levels, including a complete restructuring of the source
code and the website, the introduction of enhanced management tools, as
well as a substantial increase in terms of size, versatility, visibility
and user base. The lifespan of Abinit 5 has moreover let us know much
better about the needs of the community and how to drive a sustainable
growth.</p>

<p>In addition to improving the development workflows and the conformance
of the source code to modern standards, the roles of the various
contributors, <i>i.e.</i> end-users, developers and maintainers, have been
clarified. Previously, everyone was modifying the source and build
system, while further advances required more specialization in the
community, <i>e.g.</i> the management of external libraries - in growing number
- which has to be done by skilled maintainers.</p>

<p>To address the issues raised by Fortran compilers, and because the
ABINIT developers are mostly scientists, it was decided to provide
support beyond the GNU Autotools (nowadays the paradigm for
binary/package generation) by developing a new build system on top of
it, while keeping backward-compatibility with the features present in
Abinit 4 as long as possible. Though it has permitted a smoother
transition, the latter constraint has also led to a certain number of
limitations. Solutions will be proposed to set Abinit 6 free from them.

<h3>The ABINIT-Wannier90 interface.</h3>
<p><em>RANGEL Toniatuh</em> - 
The numerous applications of the Maximaly-Localized Wannier Functions
(MLWFs) have motivated many people to work on the development of an
interface between ABINIT [1] and Wannier90 [2]. The implementation was
first started by Bernard Amadon, and Fran�ois Jollet some years ago [3].
From the beginning, the interface was developed to work with Projected
Augmented Waves (PAW) and Norm Conserving pseudopotentials.</p>
<p>     As a first improvement to this existing interface, we have provided a
variety of possible initial guess for the MLWFs. Indeed, the choice of this
initial guess can considerably speed up the convergence of the localization
procedure. In particular, for the conduction bands, the convergence cannot
be achieved starting with at random.</p>
<p>     More recently, we have extended this interface in order to use it in the
framework of Many-Body Perturbation Theory (MBPT) for GW calculations. First, the MLWFs can be used to obtain the complete bandstructure
based on the GW corrections computed only for a set of special k-points,
hence providing a very efficient interpolation scheme. Second, the MLWFs
can also be obtained for the quasiparticle wavefunctions when self-consistent
GW calculations are performed [4].</p>
<p>     As a result of these developments, ABINIT 5.7 has a very robust and
user-friendly interface with Wannier90 which can be used with PAW and
Norm Conserving pseudopotentials for ground state and GW calculations.</p>

<h3>Non-collinear magnetism and spin-orbit coupling within PAW</h3>
<!--<a class="pdf" href="pdf/Torrent-SpinOrbit.pdf"><img src="pdf.png" alt="pdf" />[308k]</a>-->
<p><em>TORRENT Marc</em> - 

On
top on existing implementation of non-collinear magnetism in ABINIT, we
have generalized it to the case of the Projector Augmented-Wave (PAW)
formalism. Introduction of wave-functions as spinors was necessary in
the PAW part of the code, as well as imaginary "on-site" potentials and
densities. I will present first the internal representation of each
PAW objects, especially on-site densities, occupation matrix and
pseudopotential strengths. In the second part of the presentation, I will detail the implementation of spin-orbit coupling in the PAW on-site terms. I
will discuss some PAW specifc aspects of the implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li>the application of symmetries on PAW objects,</li>
<li>the problem of the
time-reversal symmetry. Then I will present some recent applications
of these implementations, and, as conclusion, detail the practical use
of the non-collinear/spin-orbit features. </li>

Two
years ago, I presented the formulae derived to apply the

of the Projector Augmented-Wave (PAW) method. I will briefly recall the
key points of the formalism and present some recently published
novelties [1]. Then I will restrict the presentation to the
implementation of phonons (response of the system to an atomic
displacement) and detail the internal representation of first-order
perturbed PAW objects and the content of some new PAW routines. A
focus on two specific aspects will be done:</p>
<ul>
<li>the generalized conjugate
gradient algorithm used to solve the generalized Sternheimer equation,</li>
<li>the case of metals.</li>
</ul>
<p> As a conclusion, I will show the first
calculations done with the DFPT+PAW and compare them with results
obtained with the norm-conserving pseudopotential approach.</p>

<h3>Finite temperature phonons and the stability of phases</h3>
<!--<a class="pdf" href="pdf/Verstraete.pdf"><img src="pdf.png" alt="pdf" />[3.5M]</a>-->
<p><em>VERSTRAETE Matthieu</em> - 

The
usefulness and implementation in ABINIT of a finite temperature ("self
consistent") phonon scheme, invented by Souvakis <i>et al.</i> in PRL 100
095901, is presented. In many crystallographic phase transitions, the
high temperature phase presents imaginary phonon modes at low
temperature. This precludes the use of the <i>ab initio</i> vibrational
spectrum to calculate thermodynamical properties. Increasing the
electronic temperature is usually not enough: it is the phonon
frequencies themselves which change with (ionic) temperature. This is
exemplified by the transition of Ti, Zr, or Hf to a BCC structure at
high temperatures, while the 0K phonons present imaginary modes.
Starting from the ground state phonons and a (typically 4x4x4)
supercell of atoms, the atomic forces, normal mode displacements, and
phonon frequencies are solved for self-consistently, accounting for the
desired temperature in the statistical occupation of the modes. In this
way the high temperature phase phonons can be stabilized, and compared
properly to experiments. First examples on Aluminium present
encouraging results.</p>

<h3>Perturbations in the PAW Formalism: DDK, Electric, and Magnetic Fields</h3>
<p><em>ZWANZIGER Josef</em> - 

Building on the general PAW DFPT scheme being implemented, we are working to add response functions to electric and magnetic fields within the PAW formalism. This project is in the development and implementation stages. Earlier work by Umari, Gonze, and Pasquarello (PRB 69, 235102 (2004)) showed how to treat both the DDK and static electric field perturbations in the ultrasoft pseudopotential case, and the DFPT PAW equations are very similar (though their implementation is more complex). I will discuss current progress in implementing these perturbations in abinit, including the additional nonlocal potentials required and the unusual asymmetric derivatives of the projectors. Then I will discuss recent work of Xavier Gonze, Marc Torrent, and myself on implementing the response to a static magnetic field. This has required significantly more new theoretical development, and will ultimately represent a substantial step forward as compared to finite-difference methods for treating this perturbation as present in CASTEP and PWSCF</p>

<h3>Properties at the Nuclei: Electric Field Gradients and M�ssbauer Isomer Shifts in the PAW Formalism</h3>
<p><em>ZWANZIGER Josef</em> - 

Key observables in M�ssbauer spectroscopy include the isomer shift and the electric field gradient at each nucleus. The electric field gradient is also observable in nuclear magnetic resonance and nuclear quadrupole resonance. Since the last workshop Marc Torrent and I have implemented the EFG in abinit, and recently I have implemented the Fermi-contact interaction, which is proportional to the isomer shift. I will briefly describe the theory of both these interactions, and show results on various compounds. In particular, I will show how the EFG acts as a useful probe of electron correlation effects in the Mott-Hubbard insulator LaTiO<sub>3</sub>, and I will show a variety of results on M�ssbauer spectra, including the effect of pressure on on Fe and ZnO.</p>

<h3>An implementation of a consistent, linear-response approach to
      DFT+U </h3>
<p><em>ADAMS Donat</em> - 
   Traditional Density functional theory [DFT] fails on electronic systems with strong
correlations. The total energy of localized electrons is afflicted with the spurious self-interaction energy. DFT+U can cancel this error by introducing a parametrized potential based on the Hubbard model. The parameters of this approximation correspond to the Coulombic repulsion (U) and the exchange energy (J). We present an implementation of a reliable ab initio method to determine these parameters [1].</p>
<p>   Our implementation in the ABINIT [2;3] code is based on the work of Cococcioni and de Gironcoli [1] and takes into account the linear response of the system to a potential shift on a localized site with strong correlations. It allows to determine U in the same framework as later the DFT+U is applied. Thus the DFT+U methodology becomes a consistent method without any free parameters.</p>
<p>   We will summarize the theory of the procedure for the determination of U and examine the impact of the following choices in the procedure: the symmetry of the unit cell, the amplitude of the shift, convergence with the system size. We will provide the possible simplifications and give an example of an applications to a reference material (<i>e.g.</i> bcc Fe).</p>

<h3>Ab-initio GW self-energy corrections in metallic systems</h3>
<p><em>CAZZANIGA Marco</em> - 

The
calculation of GW corrections in metallic systems is prone to the
problem ofintraband contributions in the small wavevector limit of the
dielectric matrix. We demonstrate that neglecting the intraband term
leads to an opening of an unphysical gap in the quasiparticle
dispersion, which only disappears using an extremely and prohibitively
dense k-point mesh. To overcome this difficulty we propose a simple
method based on a fit on the asymptotical trend of the independent
particle polarizability [1], correcting the wrong term of the
dielectric matrix. We are planning to include this approach in ABINIT. This
simple approach preforms well in combination with the plasmon pole
model, providing correct bandwidths, and adding no computational
overhead with respect to a standard calculation for semiconductors. On
the other hand, going beyond the plasmon-pole model with a contour
deformation approach reveals problematic for very small frequencies,
and different approaches have to be preferred. We discuss the
possibility of calculate quasiparticle corrections for metallic systems
also with method beyond the Plasmon pole model.

<h3>Implementation of Raman scattering for spin polarized systems</h3>
<p><em>DA PIEVE Fabiana</em> - 
Raman spectroscopy is one of the most spread tool in order to study lattice dynamics. The intensities of the Raman peaks and thus the calculations of the full Raman spectra depend on the mode frequencies, which are obtained straightforwardly from the diagonalization of the dynamical matrix in the density functional perturbation theory, and on the Raman tensors, which represent the first derivative of the dielectric tensor with respect to the atomic displacement pattern corresponding to the vibrational mode. The Raman tensors can be computed either from finite differences, as the change of the dielectric tensor due to infinitesimal atomic displacements, or from perturbation theory, as the third order derivative of the energy with respect to two electric fields and one atomic displacement. Actually in the ABINIT code it is only possible to calculate the Raman tensor for LDA functionals. However, it is sometimes necessary to go beyond this simple approximation, either by supporting the spin polarized LDA case, or going beyond LDA.  </p>
<p>I will report on the current effort going on in order to implement the spin polarized case, which will allow to study Raman scattering from magnetic systems. Work is in progress, and we will give a simple description of the project, as well as the already  
established formal results.  </p>

<h3>Implementation of the modern theory of polarization within the PAW method</h3>
<p><em>HERMET Patrick</em> - 
    Nowadays, the modern theory of polarization is intensively used to compute the spontaneous polarization in ferroelectrics or the Born effective charge tensors in materials.</p>
<p>    Several years ago, King-Smith and Vanderbilt gave a formulation that allows for the calculation of the electronic polarization of an insulating crystal in the context of a conventional electronic band structure calculation [1]. They showed that the contribution of a given band to the electronic polarization could be expressed as a geometric quantum phase or Berry phase of the cell-periodic Bloch function <i>u<sub>k</sub></i> as the wave-vector <i>k</i> is adiabatically transported by a reciprocal lattice vector. Resta has given a review of this theory [2]. This theory can be applied straightforwardly in the context of an all-electron scheme, or any norm-conserving pseudopotential scheme. However, in the case of ultrasoft pseudopotential scheme or projected augmented waves (PAW) method, the pseudo-wavefunctions do not obey a conventional normalization condition, and the Berry phase expression must be modified according to Ref. 3.</p>
<p>    In this talk, I present the appropriate formulation of the electronic polarization within the PAW method as implemented in the ABINIT package and I give an example of input file using this implementation. In addition, I compare the Born effective charge tensors of alpha-bithiophene calculated using the Berry phases within the PAW method and the ones calculated using the norm-conserving scheme. The theoretical infrared spectrum of this material will also be confronted to the experimental one.</p>
<p>    This implementation is the result of a strong collaboration with the CEA of Bruy�res-Le-Chatel.</p>

<h3>Improving Abinit calculations scalability for large systems :  implementation of the RMM-DIIS algorithm</h3>
<p><em>JANSSEN Laflamme Jonathan</em> - 

The current conjugate gradient method implemented in Abinit for the  iterative diagonalisation of the Kohn-Sham hamiltonian allows SCF  calculations up to a few hundreds of electrons on current computers.  The interest in condensed matter for large simulated systems such as  complex nanostructures or amorphous systems requires better  scalability with number of electrons in <i>ab initio</i> calculations. The  current conjugate gradient method scaling is dominated, in large  systems, by the <i>O(N<sup>3</sup>)</i> orthonormalization step done at each band  update. The residual minimization method - direct inversion in the  iterative subspace (RMM-DIIS) allows to reduce the number of <i>O(N<sup>3</sup>)</i>  operations by performing orthogonalisation of eigenvectors only after  sweeping over all bands, before each charge density update. This  poster discusses the project of this implementation in Abinit.</p>

<h3>PAW positron lifetime calculation with ABINIT
</h3>
<p><em>JOMARD Gerald</em> - 
Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy is a powerful technique to detect and characterize vacancy-type defects in solids. The repulsive Coulomb potential of the nuclei pushes the positron into vacancies making positrons particularly sensitive to defects. However, experimentally, one can only measure a mean positron lifetime that contains the contributions of all type of defects present in the sample. Consequently, characterizing the defects in a sample requires knowledge of the specific lifetimes for various possible defect structures as well as the undefected bulk. The use of the TCDFT framework (Two Components Density Functional Theory) allows for the calculation of such quantities. As we are interested in MOX nuclear fuels (UO<sub>2</sub>-PuO<sub>2</sub> mixtures) we know that we need to go beyond LDA in order to correctly describe the strong electronic correlations arising in these systems. We choose to work within the LDA+U framework which is available in the PAW method in ABINIT. For that reason we are currently implementing the TCDFT in the PAW formalism. Both formalism and first applications will be presented in this talk.</p>

<h3>Improvements in STM calculations and implementation of kinetic energy density in ABINIT </h3>
<!--<a class="pdf" href="pdf/Lherbier.pdf"><img src="pdf.png" alt="pdf" />[908k]</a>-->
<p><em>LHERBIER Aur�lien</em> - STM current calculations in ABINIT are presently implemented under the single s-orbital Tersoff-Hamann tip approximation. However, p- and d-orbitals of the STM tip should also present a non-negligible contribution to the total current and are thus sometimes required to obtain a better STM image. This improvements in the tunneling current calculations in ABINIT will be described. As a by-product, such an implementation gives also access to the kinetic energy density. The latter quantity is used in the Electron Localization Function (ELF) theory to track down the localized electrons as well as in the meta-GGA. Its implementation in ABINIT will also be presented.

<p><em>ROMERO Aldo Humberto</em> -Gathering the contributions of the ABINIT developer : the whole story.

We will discuss different implementations to calculate energy reaction paths within ABINIT. In particular, we will focus in the most recent implementation by using the string method, where we are able to find the minimum energy path as well as to locate the transition state to any accuracy. If time allows, we will describe the recent intents to implement the method of metadynamics and to create an interface with ABINIT.</p>

<h3>GW without empty states: Beyond the COHSEX approximation</h3>
<p><em>BERGER Arjan</em> - 
The GW approximation (GWA) to the self-energy[1] has proved to be very successful in 
the calculation of quasi-particle energies for a wide range of solids. However,
the GWA is computationally expensive which is mainly due to the slow convergence
with the number of unoccupied states that have to be taken into account. This has led to to search 
for simplified approximations such as the COHSEX approximation[1] 
in which there is no sum over unoccupied states. However, the COHSEX
quasi-particle energies are, in general, not close to the GW energies.
A different strategy is to look for a more efficient approach to calculate 
the GW self-energy such that only a small number of unoccupied states are required[2].
In this way the GW accuracy is retained.
In this work we will go beyond the COHSEX approximation and obtain
an approximation to the GWA without empty states but with a better accuracy than the COHSEX
approximation.

<h3>Raman and infrared spectra of hydrogenated and deuterated talc</h3>
<p><em>BEZACIER Lucile</em> - 
        Raman spectroscopy is a fundamental tool for characterizing crystal symmetry and interatomic bonding. It can also be successfully used as an identification method. Until recently the standard calculations reported only the peak positions for Raman and infrared modes. The very recent algorithmic developments and their implementations in two first-principles packages (ABINIT and PWSCF) allow today the full calculation of Raman spectra.</p>
<p>        We use the latest development of the ABINIT package to compute the variation of the Raman and infrared spectra as a function of pressure for hydrogenated and deuterated talc. For the infrared we determine the peak position and for the Raman both peak positions and intensities. We find a good agreement with experiment.</p>
<p>        We perform a detailed analysis of the vibrational pattern, with a particular emphasis on the participation of the hydrogen/deuterium atoms. This can be used next as a basis to estimate the isotope partitioning coefficients between various Earth's upper mantle hydrous minerals.

<h3>Improved description of Schottky barriers at metal/ferroelectric interfaces </h3>
<p><em>BILC Ioan Daniel</em> - 
Understanding the behavior of metal/ferroelectric heterostructures and determining the Schottky barrier   at the interface is not only theoretically interesting but also crucial for device applications. To quantify the Schottky barriers is however not an easy task, neither at experimental nor at theoretical level. DFT calculations within the usual approximations (LDA/GGA) systematically underestimate the band gaps of typical ferroelectrics by a factor of ~2, hampering therefore further correct description of the barrier with a metal. GW corrections can eventually be considered, but are computationally heavy and do not allow for self-consistent atomic relaxation. To bypass these problems, we consider here the recently proposed B1-WC hybrid functional.[1] This hybrid is able to describe both structural and electronic (band gaps) properties of prototypical ferroelectrics and multiferroics.[2] A comparison between the electronic band structure of BaTiO<sub>3</sub>, within B1-WC and GW approximation (using ABINIT code) will be shown.  B1-WC allows us to provide improved first-principle description of Schottky barriers at the interfaces between different ferroelectrics (BaTiO<sub>3</sub>, PbTiO<sub>3</sub>) and metal electrodes (Al, Ag, Au, Cu, Pt, SrRuO<sub>3</sub>). The differences and main trends will be discussed. These successful results question the relevance and interest of implementing hybrid functional approaches (B1-WC, HSE) in future versions of ABINIT.

<h3>DFT Calculations on the Thermoelectric Zn<sub>1-x</sub>Cd<sub>x</sub>Sb and Mg<sub>2</sub>Si                      Phases Using Abinit </h3>
<p><em>BOULET Pascal</em> -        The ZnSb and Mg<sub>2</sub> Si compounds are well-known for their thermoelectric properties.        The figure of merit which characterizes the efficiency of the thermoelectric materials is enhanced in ZnSb by substituting Zn for Cd. It was evidenced in the literature that the solid solution Zn<sub>1-x</sub>Cd<sub>x</sub>Sb exists from ZnSb to CdSb. However, some doubts remain concerning the existence of an ordered phase around 50 at.% of cadmium. We therefore performed DFT calculations on the Zn<sub>1-x</sub>Cd<sub>x</sub>Sb solid solution using the PBE functional in order to bring additional information. This theoretical investigation, which was undertaken on this system for the first time, should allow us to know the relative stabilities of the ordered and disordered phases with respect to the composition. </p>

<h3>Spin and structural transitions in AlFeO<sub>3</sub> and FeAlO<sub>3</sub> perovskite and post- perovskite </h3>
<p><em>CARACAS Razvan</em> - 

We
use an advanced formalism within the density functional theory to
investigate the perovskite and post- perovskite structures with AlFeO<sub>3</sub>
chemistry. We consider two ordered cases: one with Fe and then one with
Al in octahedral coordination. For each case we investigate several
spin configurations. We observe that up to 90 GPa the FeAlO<sub>3</sub> perovskite
structure, <i>i.e.</i> with Fe3+ in the inter-octahedral space, with
antiferromagnetic configuration and large local magnetic moment is the
most stable one. Beyond 90 GPa the post-perovskite structure of AlFeO<sub>3</sub>,
<i>i.e.</i> with Fe3+ in octahedral coordination, with antiferromagnetic
configuration and small local magnetic moment is the most stable one.
The perovskite to post-perovskite phase transition at 90GPa triggers a
partial collapse of the magnetic moment. The local magnetic moment
vanishes beyond 150 GPa in post-perovskite.</p>

<h3>SrTiO<sub>3</sub> and BaTiO<sub>3</sub> surface reconstructions from first principle calculations </h3>
<p><em>ILES Nadia</em> - 
Using a Norm Conserving Pseudo-Potential method NCPP and the Density Functional Theory DFT implemented in ABINIT code, we present here a comparative study of the thermodynamic stability of (001) reconstructed surfaces of BaTiO<sub>3</sub> and SrTiO<sub>3</sub> perovskites. For this purpose we compute surface energy and atomic relaxations for the (1x1), (2x1) and (2x2) model reconstructions, with AO (A ? Sr, Ba) and TiO<sub>2</sub> as possible terminations. Thereafter, we use a thermodynamic approach based on the calculation of the surface free energy Gs, in order to compute the stability of the previous reconstructions with respect to the chemical potentials of the components A and O. The recently proposed TiO<sub>2</sub> double layer (2x2) reconstruction with characteristic TiO<sub>2</sub> zigzag chains is analyzed and estimated to be the most stable one for very Ti-rich conditions. We discuss the role of the atomic coordination number and surface stress on the thermodynamic stability of the various models.

<h3>Structural characterization of methanol monohydrate under pressure: a first principles study</h3>
<p><em>MARTINEZ Davila</em> - 
Methanol monohydrate is one of several crystalline phases present in the methanol-water system. At ambient conditions of pressure, methanol monohydrate has a disordered structure, which is also polar. Here we study its behavior under pressure using the density-functional theory in the ABINIT implementation. We propose several initial ideally ordered configurations that we optimize at different pressures. We analyze the energy and compressibility of the different structures under pressure. A new monoclinic structure is proposed with space group Cc (#9), which is competitive (~meV difference) with a similar structure with space group P21 (#4); the two configuration can go from one to the other easily by hydrogen reordering. Hydrogen bonds play a major role in the structures. X-ray diffraction patterns based on the theoretical structures have been generated and compared with experimental neutron diffractions. Next, Raman spectra will be calculated for the optimized structures within abinit to compare and interpret the experimental data.

<h3>EXCITON: A Gaussian orbital code for solid state spectroscopy</h3>
<p><em>PATTERSON Charles</em> - 
EXCITON is a new Gaussian orbital code for periodic systems which is intended primarily for simulation of electron and optical spectroscopies of crystalline solids.  It is interfaced to the Crystal code and an SCF module for scHF, hybrid density functionals and scGW is under development.  A module for treating excitations via Bethe-Salpeter integral equations is also under development. EXCITON makes full use of crystal space group symmetries in order to minimise computer time and generate irreducible representations of various states.  Some of these features of the code are described here. We present results of Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations on solid rare gases, single-particle optical excitations at silicon surfaces reconstructed by Au adsorption, visualisation of wavefunctions and Fermi surfaces in superconductors, all performed using EXCITON.

<h3>PAW+U study of the La<sub>2-x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> phonon spectra</h3>
<p><em>PESANT Simon</em> - 

The electronic and vibrational properties of the superconductor La<sub>2-x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> were studied using the projected augmented waves (PAW) method and density functional theory.  We simulated the strontium hole doping by removing a finite charge in the density of La<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>. For the optimal hole doping (1/8), the GGA functional gives a metallic ground state. Adding a Hubbard term to the functional (GGA+U), the ground state becomes a Stripe ordered phase. The effect of stripe ordering on the half breathing modes of the optimally doped La<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> was studied and compared to the GGA phonon frequencies for the same doping.</p>

<h3>Band Offsets Prediction From Many Body Perturbation Theory</h3>
<p><em>SHALTAF Riad</em> - 

We use many-body perturbation theory, the state-of-the-art method for band gap calculations, to compute the band offsets at the Si/SiO<sub>2</sub> interface. We examine the adequacy of the usual approximations in this context. We show that (i) the separate treatment of band-structure and potential lineup contributions, the latter being evaluated within density-functional theory, is justified, (ii) most plasmon-pole models lead to inaccuracies in the absolute quasiparticle corrections, (iii) vertex corrections can be neglected, (iv) eigenenergy self-consistency is adequate. Our theoretical offsets agree with the experimental ones within 0.3 eV. On the other hand we show that that the success of DFT- LDA approximation in predicting accurately the band offsets for some systems such as ZrO<sub>2</sub>/Si, can be traced back to of cancellation errors.</p>

<h3>Lattice dynamics and specific heat of alpha - GeTe: a        theoretical and experimental study </h3>
<p><em>SHALTAF Riad</em> - 

We have investigated the dynamical and specific heat of GeTe in its low tem- perature rhombohedral phase using first-principles density functional theory. We report the phonon dispersion curves, the density of phonon states and tempera- ture dependent specific heat. In contrast to results for other IV-VI materials, we found that the inclusion of spin orbit coupling has a small effect on the calculated phonon frequencies and consequently on the heat capacity. On the other hand, we found that ignoring non-stoichiometric effects of GeTe, leads to discrepancies between the calculated and the measured Cp /T 3. These can be resolved by taking into account the existence of free hole carriers which lead to an increase of Cp /T 3 in agreement with experimental findings. Such increase was found to be due to phonon frequency softening and the corresponding down shift of the density of phonon states. </p>
